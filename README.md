# Codsoft Internship Projects Repository
Welcome to the Codsoft Internship Projects repository! In this repository, you will find a collection of simple but useful applications that I developed during my internship at Codsoft. These applications are designed to showcase my basic python programming skills and are perfect for beginners looking to learn and improve their coding abilities.

## Todo List
Description: The Todo List application is a tkinter gui application. Users can add tasks, cross and uncross out tasks, and remove tasks from the list. It's a great way to practice fundamental data structures and control flow in programming.

Usage: To use the Todo List application, simply `run the todo_list.py` file in your command line. Follow the on-screen instructions to add, view, and manage your tasks.

## Simple Calculator
Description: The Simple Calculator application is a basic calculator that can perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This application helps users practice working with user input, functions, and conditional statements.

Usage: Run the calculator.py file to launch the Simple Calculator. Follow the prompts to perform calculations and obtain results.

## Password Generator
Description: The Password Generator is a utility that generates strong, random passwords. Users can specify the length of the passwords they need. This project provides hands-on experience with random number generation and string manipulation.

Usage: Execute the password_generator.py script to run the Password Generator. You will be prompted to enter the desired password length, and the tool will generate a password accordingly.
